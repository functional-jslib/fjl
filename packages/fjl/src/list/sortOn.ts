   * Sort a list by comparing the results of a key function applied to each
   * element. sortOn f is equivalent to sortBy (comparing f), but has the
   * performance advantage of only evaluating f once for each element in the
   * input list. This is called the decorate-sort-undecorate paradigm, or
   * Schwartzian transform.
   *
   * Elements are arranged from from lowest to highest, keeping duplicates
   * in the order they appeared in the input.
   *
   * Ex:
   * ```
   * shallowEquals(
   *  sortOn (head, [[2, "world"], [4, "!"], [1, "Hello"]]),
   *  [[1,"Hello"],[2,"world"],[4,"!"]]
   * ) // true
   * ```
   * @function module:list.sortOn
   * @param valueFn {Function}
   * @param xs {Array|String|*}
   * @returns {Array}
