## Change log
### 1.12.10
- Removed un-required dependencies and stale dependencies (tui-* jsdoc template modules etc.).
- Removed node 1.15 from .travis.yml.

### 1.11.0
- Added `defineEnumProp`, `defineEnumProps`, 
`defineProp`, `defineProps` methods (easier idomatic way to 
define "typed" properties (in plain vanilla js (mostly useful for libraries et. al.))).
- dev-dependencies update.

### 1.10.8 - 1.10.10
- Readme file updates, dev-dependencies update.

### 1.10.7
- Consolidated typescript type files into one types file.

### 1.10.6
- Made 'jsPlatform' module public.
- Added typescript types for all previously defined "public" modules."

### 1.10.3
- Added './types' dir for typescript type files (added in earlier commits though formerly announcing here).
- Added types file to package.json (at 'types' property).
- Refactored type definitions, a bit, (from what they were before - they were committed in earlier commits though their 
format wasn't finalized yet).
- Updated readme with note on typescript types file.
- Fixed typo in 'filter' type in list.d.ts - It's return value was marked as `void` updated to `any[]`.
- Added `warn` function to console module and to library.
- Regenerated docs, readme etc..

### 1.10.0
- Added some synonyms:
  - `isLoosely` for `isOfType`
  - `isStrictly` for `isType`
  - `isStrictlyOneOf` for `isOneOf`
- Cleaned up, tablelized, and optimized some tests ('./tests/test-object').
- Optimized some implementations (`src/object/is`)

#### New addition:  
  - `isLooselyOneOf` - For type checking with mix-match
  type refs (constructor names and constructors):
  ```javascript
  const someValue = 'someValue';
  isLooselyOneOf(someValue, 'Undefined', Function, 'Map'); 
  // `false` - Doesn't match any type.
  
  isLooselyOneOf(someValue, 'Undefined', String, 'Map'); 
  // `true` - Matches `String`
  
  isLooselyOneOf(someValue, 'Undefined', 'String', 'Map'); 
  // `true` - Matches 'String'
  ```
  - `instanceOfOne` - `instanceOf` for one or more types:
  ```javascript
  const someValue = 'hello';
  instanceOfOne(someValue, Function, String, Array)
  // `true` matches - String
  ```
  
### 1.9.0
- Added `toFunction` (for functional composition of values that must pass as functions).

### 1.8.0 
- Added `trampoline` method (for tail call elimination).

### 1.7.0
#### Deprecations
- Marked `hasOwnProperty` as deprecated (as property
 is not really in the haskell prelude and is a bit
 of an oddity when it comes to the functional mindset).
 
#### New additions
- Re-instantiated `flip3`, `flip4`, `flip5` - Turns out there was a use for these after-all (`fjl.native`).
- Added `native` which includes all the 
static methods that live on `Object` though
flipped and curried.
- Added 'fjl-mutable' as part of source.  All methods of 'fjl-mutable' now
live directly on 'fjl' and are defined in 'fjl/objects/defineProp' (or more directly in src at './src/objects/defineProp').

#### Development changes.
- Updated  'dev-deps' to use latest babel.
- Updated gulp version
- Updated .travis* file.
- Moved './gulpfile.js' to 'gulpfile.babel.js'  in order to easily use es6 imports.

### 1.6.2
- String support for `takeWhile`, `group`, and `groupBy`, `dropWhileEnd`.
- Tablelized tests for `takeWhile`, `dropWhileEnd`, and `dropWhileEnd`.

### 1.6.0
- A few more functions now support strings:
    - `map`, `intersperse`, `append`, `reverse`, and `concat`.
- `range` function doc-block updated.
- `listUtil` functions updated and their docs unblocked from jsdocs.
- `listUtil` methods are now exported from 'src/list'.
- Tests overhaul stage 1 progress.  
    - Converted some tests to table format (where implementations were touched and 
        where the functional programming style was too extreme).
    - Removed some library functions from tests where said functions were not being tested (use native functions for tests only (no-library functions intermingle (in tests))).
- Cleaned up imports in some places to protect from cyclic dependency issues.

### 1.5.1, 1.5.2
- Added './types/index.d.ts' file.

### 1.5.0
#### Breaking changes
- `reduceRightUntil` changed to `reduceUntilRight`.
- `lengthsToSmallest` changed to `toShortest`.

##### Changes that affect development of the library:
- package.json.scripts - Removed unnecessary commands (cleaned up scripts section).
- Updated gulp to version 4.
- Updated gulpfile to use new `gulp 4` api.
- Removed unnecessary dev dependencies:
    - random-js
    - lazypipe
    - requirejs
    - gulp-fncallback

#### Other changes
- Cleaned up README.md to reflect latest changes.
- Curried functions (functions curried via `curry*` functions) now retain their arity property value (`length` value).

### 1.3.0
- Added `noop` (no-op (op as in operation)) method (useful as a placeholder for variables/properties that should always contain a function).
- Added test for `noop` addition.
- Updated './docs'.
- Added entry in 'docs' config to take into account upcoming logo for 'fjl'.
